According to the information provided by Steve's parents, in the request made by Steve to us to be able to carry out the analysis of whether his parents' investment in the DAQO New Energy Corportaiton green energy company is the best option.

•	DQ Analysis 2018

Based on the results obtained, the company DQ New Energy Corporation, as a percentage of its investment return, is considered not to be a good option since its annual return was -63, therefore, Steve is informed that the DQ company is not a viable option for your parents to invest all their funds as this would bring them losses on their investment and possible expected profits.

•	Analysis of various green energy companies

In terms of the analysis of other companies, to know what would be the best investment option for Steve's parents, a code was made with which we could visualize that the best company to make the investment as a first option is RUN since obtained an annual return of 84% and ENPH as a second option since it obtained an annual return of 81.9%, hoping that the funds of Steve's parents can be diversified between these two options of companies.
